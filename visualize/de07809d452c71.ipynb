PyCaret allows you to go from preparing data to deploying models within seconds from your choice of notebook environment.\n\nIn comparison with the other open source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few words only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Microsoft LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM), [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), and many more.\n\nPyCaret is simple and easy to use. All the operations performed in PyCaret are sequentially stored in a Pipeline that is fully orchestrated for deployment. Whether its imputing missing values, transforming categorical data, feature engineering or even hyperparameter tuning, PyCaret automates all of it. To learn more about PyCaret, watch this 1-minute video. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scd6KS03NiE\n\n# Getting Started with PyCaret\nThe first stable release of PyCaret version 1.0.0 can be installed using pip.
