This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas.

Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting.

Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss, causing very little change in the norm of the weight vector."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "7caf4dc8", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## About Detecting Fake News with Python\n\nThis advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news.
