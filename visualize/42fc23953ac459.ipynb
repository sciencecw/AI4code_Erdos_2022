That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.\n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.\n\nwe will use the classic titanic data set. This dataset contains information about **11 different variables**:\n<img src=\"http://s9.picofile.com/file/8340453092/Titanic_feature.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"500\">\n\n* Survival\n* Pclass\n* Name\n* Sex\n* Age\n* SibSp\n* Parch\n* Ticket\n* Fare\n* Cabin\n* Embarked\n\n\n### 3-3-1 Why use Titanic dataset?\n\n1- This is a good project because it is so well understood.\n\n2- Attributes are numeric and categorical so you have to figure out how to load and handle data.\n\n3- It is a ML problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.\n\n4- we can define problem as clustering(unsupervised algorithm) project too.\n\n5- because we love   **Kaggle** :-) .\n\n<a id=\"5\"></a> <br>\n### 3-2 Aim\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.  For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.\n\n<a id=\"6\"></a> <br>\n### 3-3 Variables\n\n1.  **Age** ==>> Age is fractional if less than 1.

Now we cannot sort or give any ordering to such variables. They are also known as Nominal Variables.\n\n**Categorical Features in the dataset: Sex,Embarked.**\n\n### 3-3-1-2 Ordinal\nAn ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like Height with values Tall, Medium, Short, then Height is a ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.\n\n**Ordinal Features in the dataset: PClass**\n\n### 3-3-1-3 Continous:\nA feature is said to be continous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.\n\n**Continous Features in the dataset: Age**\n\n**<< Note >>**\n> You must answer the following question:\nHow does your company expact to use and benfit from your model."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "1ebe9df9", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<a id=\"7\"></a> <br>\n## 4- Inputs & Outputs\n<a id=\"8\"></a> <br>\n### 4-1 Inputs\n**Titanic** is a very popular **Machine Learning**   problem with a **multivariate data set** .\n<a id=\"9\"></a> <br>\n### 4-2 Outputs\nYour score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification.
