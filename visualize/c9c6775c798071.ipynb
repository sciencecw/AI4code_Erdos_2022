Indeed, data science has become a promising area in cybersecurity, since analytical models based on data allow for the discovery of insights that can help to predict malicious activities.\n\nWe can analyze cyber threats using two techniques, static analysis, and dynamic analysis, the most important thing is that these are the approaches to get the features that we are going to use in data science.\n\n+ **Static analysis**: it includes the methods that allow us to get information about the software that we want to analyze without executing it, one example of them is the study of the code, their callings, resources, etc.\n+ **Dynamic analysis**: it is another approach where the idea is to analyze the cyber threat during its execution, in other words, get information about its behavior, some of their features are the netflows.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "e415b16c", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# State of the Art\n\nIn 2016 we published an article [2] about the state of the art of frameworks and results about Android malware detection.
