Introduction\nIn this Kernel is made an approach using three Python modules as the pillars: [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), [Pandas Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) and [H2O](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o/), but why to use these modules? Because they can do so much work writing just a few lines of code speeding up the process, therefore the name \"Fastanic\".<br>\n\nThe fastai loads a lot of useful modules, as Pandas and Numpy, Pandas Profiling can generate a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with just one code line and H2O using its AutoML module can train different Machine Learning models and ensemble it to make good predictions, but remember there's [*No Free Lunch*](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-blog-about-lunch-and-data-science-how-there-is-no-such-a-thing-as-free-lunch-e46fd57c7f27), fastai is good but maybe you will need other modules to make your EDA, Pandas Profiling is not good to report in large datasets (I tried to use on [Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction) without sucess) and H2O AutoML can take a big amount of time to train all the models.<br>\n\nThe Legendary Competition to predict the survivors of Titanic Disaster is a good start point to apply these great modules and understand how to work with them and know their pros and cons. This dataset is small enough to use these tools and give a good idea when to use they and we can dedicate more time to understand the data and apply Feature Engineering (FE) to it.\n\n### 1.1 The Challenge\n\nThe [sinking of the Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic) is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.<br>\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered \u201cunsinkable\u201d RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.<br>\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.<br>\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \"what sorts of people were more likely to survive?\" using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).<br>\n\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.<br>\nFor each in the test set, you must predict a 0 (Dead) or 1 (Survived)  value for the variable.<br>\nYour score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict, the accuracy.<br>\n\n### 1.2 Data\nSome variables to take note for insights:<br>\n* **pclass**: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br>\n1st = Upper<br>\n2nd = Middle<br>\n3rd = Lower<br>\n\n* **age**: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5<br>\n\n* **sibsp**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>\nSibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br>\nSpouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc\u00e9s were ignored)<br>\n\n* **parch**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>\nParent = mother, father<br>\nChild = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br>\nSome children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.<br>\n\n# 2.

The plot indicates a small class imbalance but there's no need for resampling and accuracy seems good to evaluate the model.<br>\n* `Age`: It's a numeric type, has almost 20% of missing values (`NaN`), the distribution has a little right skewness but is near from Normal. There's a small negative correlation with `Survived`, indicating that youngers could have a better chance to survive than the oldest.  <br>\n* `Cabin`: Categorical feature, has a lot of missing values (77.1%) and some passengers have more than one cabin. Maybe the first letter could indicate the deck area, then it is considered as a relevant feature. <br>\n* `Embarked`: Another categorical feature, has only 2 missing values, drop these values on Feature Engineering step will not harm the model. <br>\n* `Fare`: Numerical feature with a right skewness. There's no missing values. Has a small positive correlation with `Survived`, indicating that the person owned a more expensive ticket and following the idea that a better Cabin/Area/Class has more chance to survive. Note that it has a mode with low values, hence the big part of passengers bought a more cheaper ticker. <br>\n* `Name`: Categorical feature. No missing values. The name structure is interesting, 'Family Name'+','+'Honorific'+'name'.\n* `Parch`: Numerical with right skewness. No missing values. Small positive correlation with `Survived`.\n* `PassengerId`: Numerical but not relevant for the prediction. Will be dropped in FE step.\n* `Pclass`: Categorical Feature. No Missing Values. There's more 3rd class passengers than others. Negative correlation with `Survived`, it reinforces the idea on `Fare`, expensive tickets allows better classes leading to most chance to survive.\n* `Sex`: Categorical Feature. The distribution indicates that have more men than women. No Missing Values.\n* `SibSp`: Numeric with a small negative correlation with `Survived`. No Missing Values.\n* `Ticket`: Categorical. No missing values but has a High Cardinality.\n\nWith all information gathered from the EDA, it's time to get insights on how to proceed in FE, that starts now."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "d3c78714", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# 4.

If you create a new feature called `Family_Name` to get the info if the Passengers are in the same family?
