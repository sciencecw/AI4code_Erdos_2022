Lomb-Scargle Periodograms for HF Noise Spectral Analysis\n---\n\n\nAs this competition will hinge largely on signal analysis, I thought I would make a feature engineering contribution that tries to isolate the main constituent frequencies amid the noise. \n\nFrequency analysis is typically performed with the [Fast Fourier Transform](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FastFourierTransform.html). This breaks down a complex waveform into its sinusoidal constituents, mapping them into freqency space with their respective amplitudes:\n\n![](https://cdn.iopscience.com/images/books/978-1-627-05419-5/live/bk978-1-627-05419-5ch8f1_online.jpg)\n\nFourier transforms act on continuous periodic functions. Since real-life data is discretised, numerical solutions have to be found via methods like DFFT (Discrete Fast Fourier Transform). However, calculating this requires a time axis with regular intervals - that is, the time difference between successive amplitude measurements is constant. Many real-life situations, along with this competition, require frequency analysis on data where the time between measurements is unequal. What's the solution? The fantasically named **Lomb-Scargle Periodogram**:\n\n![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781785282287/graphics/B04223_06_11.jpg)\n\nIf this is new to you, please take a moment to say it again out loud. Great stuff! LSP is one approach among many for least-squares spectral analysis problems, and I'm sure other kagglers will find better solutions. But it's early days in the competition so hopefully this will help you get started! For a comprehensive primer on LSP, I strongly recommend [reading this article (PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09824.pdf).\n\nThe test data doesn't include the time axis since that is our target, so when adding features you'll have to assume the time difference between measurements is even. With train.csv we can't make that assumption, which is why I tried this approach.\n\nFor speed, I'll be running this kernel on the data for the first earthquake period in train.csv only. I encourage other readers to expand on it for their own work - you might stumble on something critical to your final performance!

For audio data, this is an extremely high frequency.\n\nHigh-frequency waves are readily attenuated by rock, and actual seismological waves generally lie in the range of 0.1-1Hz since they travel further and hence have more predictive and forensic value. This experiment was at a much smaller scale however, so analysis of higher frequencies may yield valuable insights. So what is the *minimum* frequency we can reliably measure?\n\nThis poses something of a conundrum. The data is time-dependant, and ideally we'd like to have a number of LSP frequency spectra to examine as TTF approaches 0. This way, any changes in the signal profile over time can be examined - this is a prediction challenge after all. But the more samples we take, but smaller the timespan they will cover, and hence the lower bound for our frequency range gets higher. For this kernel I'm naively choosing a range of 10000 rows to get 566 different readings for the first earthquake, equivalent to around 0.0021 seconds per segment. For this the minimum frequency we could expect to differentiate would be approximately 1/0.021s or ~ 475Hz.\n\nFor future kernels I'll try a sliding-window approach with a larger number of samples to increase the frequency resolution and examine if low-frequencies have any notable trends in the training data.
