It has been nearly two years since the world recorded the first case of COVID-19. Fortunately, we have produced several types of vaccines against the pandemic. If you regurlarly update daily news, you must see and hear about COVID-19 statistics. In case you are wondering how people work with it, then this notebook is suitable for you. In this notebook, I mainly focus on analyzing information that related to the vaccinations progress. We will go through step by step to reach the final result. This notebook is also suitable for those who are at beginner level or intermediate. Follow this notebook thoroughly, you will get all of the information I provided since I explained everything in detail.\n\nThis project uses Python languague.\n\nMany thanks to Gabriel Preda and Rishav Sharma for providing the two dataframes."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "e162685e", "metadata": {}, "source": ["**I.
