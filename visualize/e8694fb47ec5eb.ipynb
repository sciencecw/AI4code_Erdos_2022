Or how does an e-commerce websites display options such as \"Frequently Bought Together\"? They may look relatively simple options but behind the scenes, a complex statistical algorithm executes in order to predict these recommendations. Such systems are called Recommender Systems, Recommendation Systems, or Recommendation Engines. A Recommender System is one of the most famous applications of data science and machine learning.\n\nA Recommender System employs a statistical algorithm that seeks to predict users' ratings for a particular entity, based on the similarity between the entities or similarity between the users that previously rated those entities. The intuition is that similar types of users are likely to have similar ratings for a set of entities.\n\nCurrently, many of the big tech companies out there use a Recommender System in one way or another. You can find them anywhere from Amazon (product recommendations) to YouTube (video recommendations) to Facebook (friend recommendations). The ability to recommend relevant products or services to users can be a huge boost for a company, which is why it's so common to find this technique employed in so many sites.\n\nIn this Kernel, we will see how we can build a simple recommender system in Python.\n\n\n## Types of Recommender Systems\n\nThere are two major approaches to build recommender systems: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering:\n\n### Content-Based Filtering\n\nIn content-based filtering, the similarity between different products is calculated on the basis of the attributes of the products. For instance, in a content-based movie recommender system, the similarity between the movies is calculated on the basis of genres, the actors in the movie, the director of the movie, etc.\n\n### Collaborative Filtering\n\nCollaborative filtering leverages the power of the crowd. The intuition behind collaborative filtering is that if a user A likes products X and Y, and if another user B likes product X, there is a fair bit of chance that he will like the product Y as well.\n\nTake the example of a movie recommender system. Suppose a huge number of users have assigned the same ratings to movies X and Y. A new user comes who has assigned the same rating to movie X but hasn't watched movie Y yet. Collaborative filtering system will recommend him the movie Y.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "df425738", "metadata": {}, "source": ["### Movie Recommender System Implementation in Python\n\nIn this section, we'll develop a very simple movie recommender system in Python that uses the correlation between the ratings assigned to different movies, in order to find the similarity between the movies.\n\nThe dataset that we are going to use for this problem is the MovieLens Dataset. To download the dataset, go to https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ or \"Movie Lens Small Latest Dataset\" from kaggle datasets, download the \"ml-latest-small.zip\" file, which contains a subset of the actual movie dataset and contains 100000 ratings for 9000 movies by 700 users.\n\nOnce you unzip the downloaded file, you will see \"links.csv\", \"movies.csv\", \"ratings.csv\" and \"tags.csv\" files, along with the \"README\" document.
