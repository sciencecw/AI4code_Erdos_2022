There is no processing or interpretation of the Python object as it is pickled or unpickled. It is an extremely lean and efficient process, and therein lies its one risk. It is possible to suffer unintended consequences to your computer or to fall victim to malicious code if you unpickle a file of unknown or untrusted origin.
