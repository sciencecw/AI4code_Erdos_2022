Tensors are basically TensorFlow's version of a Numpy array with a few differences that make them better suited to deep learning. One of the most important is that tensors are compatible with [GPU](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/efficient-gpu-usage) and [TPU](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu)) accelerators. TPUs, in fact, are designed specifically for tensor computations.\n\nA model's weights are kept in its `weights` attribute as a list of tensors. Get the weights of the model you defined above.

Regression problems are like \"curve-fitting\" problems: we're trying to find a curve that best fits the data. Let's take a look at the \"curve\" produced by a linear model. (You've probably guessed that it's a line!)\n \nWe mentioned that before training a model's weights are set randomly.
