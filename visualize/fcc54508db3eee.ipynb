In September 2016, the company estimated that there are over 100 million active players each month.[2] It also has a large competitive scene involving dozens of teams participating in both national and international tournaments. \n\nThe game takes place across two broadly defined phases. In the first phase (or Drafting phase), each side takes turns assembling their team by selecting a unique character (called a champion) from a pool of 145 (as of this writing) without replacement. Then, in the second phase (or Game phase), each player in the match takes control of one of the champions chosen by their team and attempts to claim victory. Although not strictly required by the game, over the years players have grown to play their champion in one of five roles named after the location on the map in which they typically start the game, and often corresponding to the amount of in-game resources that player will have devoted to them.\n\n\n\nThis report will be mainly focusing on drafting and how it will affecting the result of a game.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "5dce9f0b", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## *1.1What is drafting in LoL and how it can affect the game?*\n\nEach champion will have their each distinct set of abilities and charateristics that allow them to excel and fall behing in different area of game situations. So in order to maximize the odd of victory, a team usually have different playstyle based on the opposing team champion composition they play against with and ones they are familiar with. Teams can abrupt or avoid certain champions pick to be played by banning them during the drafting phase.There are two types of submissions made during the drafting phase. In the banning portions of the draft champions are removed from the pool of allowed submissions, whereas champions are added to the roster of the submitting team during the pick phases. The drafting alternates between banning and picking until both teams have a full roster of five champions, at which point the game is played. The structure of the drafting phase is displayed in Figure below. Note the asymmetry between teams (for example Blue bans first in ban phase one, while Red bans first in ban phase two) and between the phases themselves (ban phases always alternate sides, while pick phases \"snake\" between teams).\n\nAlthough different team composition might have bring advantanges to the team with better draft. The result of a game is always uncertain due to lots undertermined factors such as player's mechanic, decision making, condition and so on, just like any regular sport.

Understanding them is crucially important, just like high field goal percentage, get to the foul line, get offensive rebounds, and not turn the ball over are important in a basketball match.\n\nBut there are still a lot stats despite carry lot of information but actually don't say much. People even lie to themself by making compelling story to predict t results by a player or a team over the course of a given season. Finally, sports with statistics always comes up to two issues: One is the fact that sports have small sample sizes, and Two is that human beings play them.
