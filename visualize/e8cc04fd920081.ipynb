Introduction to Random Forest algorithm** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nRandom forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It has two variations \u2013 one is used for classification problems and other is used for regression problems. It is one of the most flexible and easy to use algorithm. It creates decision trees on the given data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It is also a pretty good indicator of feature importance.\n\n\nRandom forest algorithm combines multiple decision-trees, resulting in a forest of trees, hence the name `Random Forest`. In the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest results in higher accuracy.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "8c26085b", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# **2.

In the first stage, we proceed as follows:-\n\n1.\tRandomly select `k` features from a total of `m` features where `k < m`.\n2.\tAmong the `k` features, calculate the node `d` using the best split point.\n3.\tSplit the node into daughter nodes using the best split.\n4.\tRepeat 1 to 3 steps until `l` number of nodes has been reached.\n5.\tBuild forest by repeating steps 1 to 4 for `n` number of times to create `n` number of trees.\n\n\nIn the second stage, we make predictions using the trained random forest algorithm. \n\n1.\tWe take the test features and use the rules of each randomly created decision tree to predict the outcome and stores the predicted outcome.\n2.\tThen, we calculate the votes for each predicted target.\n3.\tFinally, we consider the high voted predicted target as the final prediction from the random forest algorithm.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "d0c3f1b5", "metadata": {}, "source": ["### Random Forest algorithm intuition\n\n![Random Forest](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/goPiwckWE9M/maxresdefault.jpg)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "88cc114f", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# **3. Advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest algorithm** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nThe advantages of Random forest algorithm are as follows:-\n\n\n1.\tRandom forest algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.\n2.\tIt is considered as very accurate and robust model because it uses large number of decision-trees to make predictions.\n3.\tRandom forests takes the average of all the predictions made by the decision-trees, which cancels out the biases. So, it does not suffer from the overfitting problem. \n4.\tRandom forest classifier can handle the missing values. There are two ways to handle the missing values. First is to use median values to replace continuous variables and second is to compute the proximity-weighted average of missing values.\n5.\tRandom forest classifier can be used for feature selection. It means selecting the most important features out of the available features from the training dataset.\n\n\nThe disadvantages of Random Forest algorithm are listed below:-\n\n\n1.\tThe biggest disadvantage of random forests is its computational complexity. Random forests is very slow in making predictions because large number of decision-trees are used to make predictions. All the trees in the forest have to make a prediction for the same input and then perform voting on it. So, it is a time-consuming process.\n2.\tThe model is difficult to interpret as compared to a decision-tree, where we can easily make a prediction as compared to a decision-tree.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "df13fde1", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# **4. Feature selection with Random Forests** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n\nRandom forests algorithm can be used for feature selection process. This algorithm can be used to rank the importance of variables in a regression or classification problem. \n\n\nWe measure the variable importance in a dataset by fitting the random forest algorithm to the data. During the fitting process, the out-of-bag error for each data point is recorded and averaged over the forest. \n\n\nThe importance of the j-th feature was measured after training. The values of the j-th feature were permuted among the training data and the out-of-bag error was again computed on this perturbed dataset. The importance score for the j-th feature is computed by averaging the difference in out-of-bag error before and after the permutation over all trees. The score is normalized by the standard deviation of these differences.\n\n\nFeatures which produce large values for this score are ranked as more important than features which produce small values. Based on this score, we will choose the most important features and drop the least important ones for model building. \n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "aa33f925", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# **5.

Confusion matrix** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"18\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n\nA confusion matrix is a tool for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm. A confusion matrix will give us a clear picture of classification model performance and the types of errors produced by the model. It gives us a summary of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each category. The summary is represented in a tabular form.\n\n\nFour types of outcomes are possible while evaluating a classification model performance. These four outcomes are described below:-\n\n\n**True Positives (TP)** \u2013 True Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a certain class and the observation actually belongs to that class.\n\n\n**True Negatives (TN)** \u2013 True Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class and the observation actually does not belong to that class.\n\n\n**False Positives (FP)** \u2013 False Positives occur when we predict an observation belongs to a    certain class but the observation actually does not belong to that class. This type of error is called **Type I error.**\n\n\n\n**False Negatives (FN)** \u2013 False Negatives occur when we predict an observation does not belong to a certain class but the observation actually belongs to that class. This is a very serious error and it is called **Type II error.**\n\n\n\nThese four outcomes are summarized in a confusion matrix given below.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "id": "93df876c", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Print the Confusion Matrix and slice it into four pieces\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n\nprint('Confusion matrix\\n\\n', cm)"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "id": "8f34dba3", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["sns.heatmap(cm,annot=True)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "d9473396", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# **19.

I build two models, one with 10 decision-trees and another one with 100 decision-trees. \n2.\tThe model accuracy score with 10 decision-trees is 0.7622 but the same with 100 decision-trees is 0.7784. So, as expected accuracy increases with number of decision-trees in the model.\n3.\tI have used the Random Forest model to find only the important features, build the model using these features and see its effect on accuracy. The most important feature is `first funding at` and least important feature is `is_counslting`.\n4.\tI have removed the `is_counslting` variable from the model, rebuild it and checked its accuracy. The accuracy of the model with `is_counslting` variable removed is 0.9264. The accuracy of the model with all the variables taken into account is 0.9247. So, we can see that the model accuracy has been improved with `doors` variable removed from the model.\n5.\tThe second least important model is `lug_boot`. If I remove it from the model and rebuild the model, then the accuracy was found to be 0.8546. It is a significant drop in the accuracy. So, I will not drop it from the model.\n6.\tConfusion matrix and classification report are another tool to visualize the model performance. They yield good performance.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "3bc8834f", "metadata": {}, "source": ["[Go to Top](#0)"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.9"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 5}
