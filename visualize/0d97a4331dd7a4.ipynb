We use it to convert numbers to probabilities. It also has several other desirable properties for training neural networks.\nNotice that this function can also generate the derivative of a sigmoid (when deriv=True). One of the desirable properties of a sigmoid function is that its output can be used to create its derivative. If the sigmoid's output is a variable \"out\", then the derivative is simply out * (1-out). This is very efficient.
