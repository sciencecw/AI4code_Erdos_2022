{"cells": [{"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "a371c26a", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Hi everyone, \n\nThis is my first kernel and am writing this with an intention of sharing  the journey to my first ML and Kaggle problem. The accuracy can still be improved and will work on it soon. :) \n\nI came up to this problem straight away after Andrew NG's Introduction to Machine Learning on Course Era. A pretty standard route for people trying to start of with ML and a decent one too. In this notebook, I tried to jot down the steps in building a predictive model for Titanic and some resources alongside. If its your first problem, its important that you take pauses in between, ponder over what you've done till then, read a bit about the step and proceed (Don't just read - read and try that segment - Its an iterative process). Having said this, there's information explosion around and its very easy to get lost (I know I'm adding more!). Its very essential that you find 2-3 kernels or notebooks which are understandable by you and stick to them.   \n\nThis model achieves a score of 0.7894, which is in the top 5% of all submissions at the time of this writing. Now that I've reached here (from 0.72248), I finally can understand and appreciate why this is a great introductory modeling exercise. The nature of the data is simple - with decent number of variables, scope for nice visualizations and can instill a sense of systematic approach that's to be taken for solving such problems. he process goes something like this - \n\n**1.** **Understand the variables (Exploratory Data Analysis):**  \n     a) Look at each individual variable and it's distribution/ counts <br>\n     b) Look at relation between the target (Survival) and remaining variables in detail <br>\n     c) We'll try to understand how the dependent variables relate amongst themselves and combinedly impact targer\n     \n   Here, we can club 'a' and 'b' steps as the number of variables are less and almost all of them are discrete. <br>\n   \n   Seaborn now becomes our alter ego. \n   [Official Documentation](http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html )of seaborn is quite elaborate and neat. It might seem a bit of a      patience tester, but worth the go through if you've time and especially if you are more of a data analyst than a scientist. A              bottom-up approach would be to look at the [example gallery](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), pick the graph        you want to represent your variables with and dive in. Another shortcut is datacamp's [Ultimate Python Seaborn Tutorial](http://datacamp.com/community/open-courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning#gs.=IXCXgA)\n   \n **2.** **Data Cleaning :** Impute the missing values and handle categorical variables (In regression problems, we can think of outliers too)\n \n **3. Feature Engineering :** Taking learnings from 1, we'll create new variables which might capture the trends we see as important and the algorithm might otherwise miss out. This particular problem requires basic feature engineering - [Here](https://elitedatascience.com/feature-engineering-best-practices) is a nice article I found. There's hell load of literature around this especially in image and speech recognition fields.\n \n **4. Modeling :**  I've used python before, but not for modeling, so wandered a bit around on the how-to (Andrew teaches it on Matlab and he gets us to implement the math of an algorithm - which is not the case here. Using ML is much much simpler than that :P). The [intro to scikit learn by Kevin Markham](http://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/ ) is must do for beginners. Its relatively slow paced and gets too basic at times. But I think everyone should watch it (even at 2x). Error analysis is an integral part of modeling. So we'll fit a model, cross validate it and tune hyper parameters (Watching the dataschool video above should clear this part)\n \n Let's get started !\n ***"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "id": "f188c6b0", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns #Visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #Visualization\n%matplotlib inline \n# ^^ Will make your plot outputs appear and be stored within the notebook.\n\nfrom itertools import chain #For ironing out lists - Can be avoided. \n                            #Using it as it'll be useful in Python for Data analyses in general\n\n#Classifiers\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n    "]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "25bd175a", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Try to keep libraries in a different cell as we would not want to run them everytime.
