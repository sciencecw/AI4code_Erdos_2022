So if you have any feedback or advice, let me know in the comments or on [Twitter](https://dbourke.link/twitter).\n\n---\n\n# \ud83d\udc36 Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.x to Classify Different Dog Breeds\n\nWho's that doggy in the window?\n\nDogs are incredible. But have you ever been sitting at a cafe, seen a dog and not known what breed it is? I have. And then someone says, \"it's an English Terrier\" and you think, how did they know that?\n\nIn this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.\n\nTo do this, we'll be using data from the [Kaggle dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview). It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.\n\nThis kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification.\n\nMulti-class image classification is an important problem because it's the same kind of technology Tesla uses in their self-driving cars or Airbnb uses in atuomatically adding information to their listings.\n\nSince the most important step in a deep learng problem is getting the data ready (turning it into numbers), that's what we're going to start with.\n\nWe're going to go through the following TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:\n![TesnorFlow WorkFlow Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/master/images/unstructured-data-tensorflow-workflow.png)\n1. Get data ready (download from Kaggle, store, import).\n2. Prepare the data (preprocessing, the 3 sets, X & y).\n3. Choose and fit/train a model ([TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), `tf.keras.applications`, [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [EarlyStopping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping)).\n4. Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).\n5. Improve the model through experimentation (start with 1000 images, make sure it works, increase the number of images).\n6. Save, sharing and reloading your model (once you're happy with the results).\n\nFor preprocessing our data, we're going to use TensorFlow 2.x. The whole premise here is to get our data into Tensors (arrays of numbers which can be run on GPUs) and then allow a machine learning model to find patterns between them.\n\nFor our machine learning model, we're going to be using a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub. \n\nThe process of using a pretrained model and adapting it to your own problem is called **transfer learning**. We do this because rather than train our own model from scratch (could be timely and expensive), we leverage the patterns of another model which has been trained to classify images.\n\n## Getting our workspace ready\n\nBefore we get started, since we'll be using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub (TensorFlow Hub), let's import them.\n\nAnd we'll also check if we're using a GPU."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "id": "07243b80", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import tensorflow as tf\nimport tensorflow_hub as hub\n\nprint(\"TF version:\", tf.__version__)\nprint(\"Hub version:\", hub.__version__)\n\n# Check for GPU\nprint(\"GPU\", \"available (YESS!!!!)\" if tf.config.list_physical_devices(\"GPU\") else \"not available :(\")"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "4ed9c285", "metadata": {}, "source": ["You might be wondering what a GPU is or why we need one.

We've used the sequential.\n\nWhich one should you use?\n\nThe Keras documentation states the functional API is the way to go for defining complex models but the sequential API (a linear stack of layers) is perfectly fine for getting started, which is what we're doing.\n\nThe first layer we use is the model from TensorFlow Hub (`hub.KerasLayer(MODEL_URL)`. So our first layer is actually an entire model (many more layers). This **input layer** takes in our images and finds patterns in them based on the patterns [`mobilenet_v2_130_224`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4) has found.\n\nThe next layer (`tf.keras.layers.Dense()`) is the **output layer** of our model. It brings all of the information discovered in the input layer together and outputs it in the shape we're after, 120 (the number of unique labels we have).\n\nThe `activation=\"softmax\"` parameter tells the output layer, we'd like to assign a probability value to each of the 120 labels [somewhere between 0 & 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function). The higher the value, the more the model believes the input image should have that label. If we were working on a binary classification problem, we'd use `activation=\"sigmoid\"`.\n\nFor more on which activation function to use, see the article [Which Loss and Activation Functions Should I Use](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-which-loss-and-activation-functions-should-i-use-ac02f1c56aa8)?\n\n## Compiling the model\n\nThis one is best explained with a story.\n\nLet's say you're at the international hill descending championships. Where your start standing on top of a hill and your goal is to get to the bottom of the hill. The catch is you're blindfolded.\n\nLuckily, your friend Adam is standing at the bottom of the hill shouting instructions on how to get down.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill there's a judge evaluating how you're doing. They know where you need to end up so they compare how you're doing to where you're supposed to be. Their comparison is how you get scored.\n\nTransferring this to `model.compile()` terminology:\n* `loss` - The height of the hill is the loss function, the models goal is to minimize this, getting to 0 (the bottom of the hill) means the model is learning perfectly.\n* `optimizer` - Your friend Adam is the optimizer, he's the one telling you how to navigate the hill (lower the loss function) based on what you've done so far. His name is Adam because the [Adam optimizer](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/) is a great general which performs well on most models. Other optimizers include [RMSprop](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html#rmsprop) and [Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent).\n* `metrics` - This is the onlooker at the bottom of the hill rating how well your perfomance is. Or in our case, giving the accuracy of how well our model is predicting the correct image label.\n\n### Building the model\n\nWe use `model.build()` whenever we're using a layer from TensorFlow Hub to tell our model what input shape it can expect.\n\nIn this case, the input shape is `[None, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 3]` or `[None, 224, 224, 3]` or `[batch_size, img_height, img_width, color_channels]`.\n\nBatch size is left as `None` as this is inferred from the data we pass the model. In our case, it'll be 32 since that's what we've set up our data batches as.\n\nNow we've gone through each section of the function, let's use it to create a model.\n\nWe can call `summary()` on our model to get idea of what our model looks like."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "id": "8e41aa74", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Create a model and check its details\nmodel = create_model()\nmodel.summary()"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "004a2c9e", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The non-trainable parameters are the patterns learned by `mobilenet_v2_130_224` and the trainable parameters are the ones in the dense layer we added.\n\nThis means the main bulk of the information in our model has already been learned and we're going to take that and adapt it to our own problem."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "7e6caf6b", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# Creating callbacks (things to help our model)\n\nWe've got a model ready to go but before we train it we'll make some callbacks.\n\nCallbacks are helper functions a model can use during training to do things such as save a models progress, check a models progress or stop training early if a model stops improving.\n\nThe two callbacks we're going to add are a TensorBoard callback and an Early Stopping callback.\n\n## TensorBoard Callback\n\n[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started) helps provide a visual way to monitor the progress of your model during and after training.\n\nIt can be used [directly in a notebook](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_in_notebooks) to track the performance measures of a model such as loss and accuracy.\n\nTo set up a TensorBoard callback and view TensorBoard in a notebook, we need to do three things:\n1.

What an effort. If you've made it this far, you've just gone end-to-end on a multi-class image classification problem.\n\nThis is the same style of problem self-driving cars have, except with different data.\n\nIf you're looking on where to go next, you've got plenty of options.\n\nYou could try to improve the full model we trained in this notebook in a few ways (there are a fair few options). Since our early experiment (using only 1000 images) hinted at our model overfitting (the results on the training set far outperformed the results on the validation set), one goal going forward would be to try and prevent it.\n\n1. [Trying another model from TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/) - Perhaps a different model would perform better on our dataset. One option would be to experiment with a different pretrained model from TensorFlow Hub or look into the [`tf.keras.applications`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications) module.\n2. [Data augmentation](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/06/07/data_aug/) - Take the training images and manipulate (crop, resize) or distort them (flip, rotate) to create even more training data for the model to learn from. Check out the [TensorFlow images](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image) documentation for a whole bunch of functions you can use on images. A great idea would be to try and replicate the techniques in [this example cat vs. dog image classification notebook](https://github.com/google/eng-edu/blob/master/ml/pc/exercises/image_classification_part2.ipynb) for our dog breeds problem.\n2. [Fine-tuning](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tf2_saved_model#fine-tuning) - The model we used in this notebook was directly from TensorFlow Hub, we took what it had already learned from another dataset (ImageNet) and applied it to our own. Another option is to use what the model already knows and fine-tune this knowledge to our own dataset (pictures of dogs). This would mean all of the patterns within the model would be updated to be more specific to pictures of dogs rather than general images.\n\nIf you're ever after more, one of the best ways to find out something is to search for something like:\n- \"How to improve a TensorFlow 2.x image classification model?\"\n- \"TensorFlow 2.x image classification best practices\"\n- \"Transfer learning for image classification with TensorFlow 2.x\"\n\nAnd when you see an example you think might be beyond your reach (because it looks too complicated), remember, if in doubt, run the code. Try and reproduce what you see. This is the best way to get hands-on and build your own knowledge.\n\nNo one starts out knowing how to do everything single thing. They just get better are knowing what to look for."]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.9"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 5}
